Questions
---------

1. What's the main reason that people leave a career in testing, according to the article? (Bear in mind it was written in 2000!) **Answer:** The article suggests that people view a position in testing as a "dead-end" job. It is suggested that because of this, many testers have the desire to "move-up" in an organization and become programmers or analysists. The article also mentions that companies tend to fill testing groups with new hires, which could weigh down on those groups' performance. The weight of taking on all the new hires, in addition to the stigma against testers, likely drives people away from testing positions.
1. What are the stages in their proposed career path for testers? **Answer:** Five different stages are mentioned, and each relates directly to a specific job title:
• **Apprenticeship** – This stage is where new hires start with the title software tester. At this stage, there is a great emphasis on learning from instructional courses and from mentors (higher-level employees).  
• **Mastery** – This stage is where software testers go after completing their apprenticeship and are given the title software test engineer. At this stage, employees become a more important part of the daily testing processes, including test planning and execution. There is still some emphasis on learning from a mentor at this stage.  
• **Specialization** – The next stage for employees involves branching out and becoming a software test specialist. At this stage, employees seek a deeper understanding of a specific area of expertise--such as test tools and automation, test equipment, or end-to-end testing. AT&T expects all competent software testers to reach this stage eventually.  
• **Leadership** – After becoming a software test specialist, employees can strive to become a lead test specialist. At this position, employees are given a choice of learning even more about their area of specialization, or learning about areas that they have less experience in. This stage involves more leadership and responsibility than previous stages. AT&T expects only a select few software test specialists to reach this stage.  
• **Reaching the Top** – The final stage is where employees become enterprise software test engineers. To reach this stage, employees must have a great understanding of both their own specialized areas and of other areas. At this stage, employees may be consulted by top management. Enterprise software test engineers must also make key strategic decisions related to testing. Employees at this stage will also mentor lead test specialists. AT&T expects only 5-10% of their software test engineers to reach this stage.
